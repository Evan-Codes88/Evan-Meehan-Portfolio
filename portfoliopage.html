                <p class="section-description">This entire website is coded by me using HTML and CSS. Throughout this project I have learnt a lot of skills as this is the first website I have Ever designed and coded. CSS has been a tricky thing to learn, especially with using flebox and responsive design but I am excited to code more and learn how to become even better!</p>
